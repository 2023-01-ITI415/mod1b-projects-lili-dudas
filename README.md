 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

 Prototype 1: 
 This prototype has a player trapped in a maze, where they can mode up, down , left, right by using the "w-a-s-d" keys. The goal is to collect as many coins as possible before finding the blue exit portal cube and advancing to the next stage. The design of this game through the framework of the Layered Tetrad is mostly built upon the mechanics, as it is a prototype functionality was a main concern. As for aesthetics, I attempted to add some visual harmony by choosing bright, yet pleasant colors. There is not much of a story on the inscribed level, though based on the player's own conclusions, at the dynamic layer it could be inferred that the player is trapped in an infinite loop in the maze, and this could be due to whatever the player decides.
